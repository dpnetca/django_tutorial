# Django Tutorial

Repository to store my progress learning Django web framework, and techniques to secure and deploy to production.  
I learn best by doing and repeating, will be lots of overlap in here as I look to different sources for different information
not all projects will follow "techniques to secure and deploy to production." many are just to learn specific components
I'll try and include links to guides and tutorials I follow for future reference.
most tutorials will not be followed exactly or through to completion, certain areas may be skipped over, or altered

## Projects:
### Local Library:
roughly based on this tutorial:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website

<!-- ### MySite:
roughly based on this tutorial:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial01/ -->

### django_docker
experimenting with creating a 3 tier docker deployment  for a simple django app

roughly based on a few guides (can't remember which all I sed components from for sure)
https://blog.devartis.com/django-development-with-docker-a-completed-development-cycle-7322ad8ba508
https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2017/03/14/production-ready-dockerfile-your-python-django-app/
https://testdriven.io/blog/dockerizing-django-with-postgres-gunicorn-and-nginx/
and / or:
various youtube videos

.env, .env.db files normally should be kept out of git repo, included here for example purposes
secret.env and secret.env.db used in "prod" docker images contain more secure information and are excluded from git
